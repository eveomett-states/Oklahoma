# Oklahoma Election Json

This shapefile was processed by Professor Ellen Veomett, her student Ananya Agarwal and Arbie Hsu using the corresponding jupyter notebook.  As part of the cleaning process, precincts were nested within counties and small rook adjacencies (under 30.5 m) were changed to queen adjacencies.
